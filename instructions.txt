To use this to convert an IDIS file into an Excel workbook:

 1. Find a dataset that you downloaded from IDIS. 
   - The filename probably starts with "Data_Extract."
   - The file's Type is probably "Compressed (zipped) Folder."

 2. Right click on that file.

 3. Click "Show more options" at the bottom of the context menu.

 4. Click "Convert IDIS to Excel" near the top of the context menu. 

 5. The Excel file will be in the same directory as the original file.


Alternately, if you added a shortcut to your desktop when you installed this, 
you can drag an IDIS file and drop it on that shortcut.
