Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) Online is a program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD). A user of IDIS can download a *data extract* containing data for CDBG, HOME, ESG, HTF, and HOPWA.  Each file in this data extract starts with a key that describes the fixed-width columns contained in that file.  A data extract consists of many such files.

This program converts an IDIS extract into an Excel spreadsheet (XSLX).  Each file in the extract becomes a tab in the spreadsheet.  

To use this utility:
1. Download `idis-converter.exe`.
2. Drag an IDIS extract like `Data_Extract_CDBG_Program-C24601.ZIP` and drop it on `idis-converter.exe`.
3. This will produce a spreadsheet, `Data_Extract_CDBG_Program-C24601.xslx`.
4. You can open and use this file in Excel.
